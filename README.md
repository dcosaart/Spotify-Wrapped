# Spotify-Wrapped


The way Spotify does their wrapped kind of sucks. You can only see your top 5 artists, and for the months January through October! I am going to create a python script that spits out an improved "wrapped" for the whole year. Which will involve the Spotify's API, and creation of reports.
