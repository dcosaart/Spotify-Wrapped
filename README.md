# Spotiy- Your Artists Wrapped!


This project does what I always wanted to do through spotify: create a playlist of one of my favorite artists. Through this code, that is achievable without the daunting task of adding the songs one by one. My project takes all the songs that you like by the artist your choosing, and puts it into one playlist for you. I wanted to create a project which I could use in the future, and I believe I have done just that. Thank you Harvard for giving me this opportunity to take this class, and I am sure it will be very useful for me in my future.
